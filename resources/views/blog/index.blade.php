        <p>    All Quiet on the Western Front premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12,
             2022, and was released to streaming on Netflix on October 28.
             [3] The film received positive reviews from critics,
              with praise directed towards its tone, the cinematography, the makeup, 
              the performances, Berger's direction, and its faithfulness to the source material's anti-war message.
              [4] It received a leading 14 nominations at the 76th British Academy Film Awards (winning seven, including Best Film) and nine at the 95th Academy Awards, 
              including Best Picture, and won four: Best International Feature, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. 
              The four wins tied All Quiet on the Western Front with Fanny and Alexander (1982), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000),
               and Parasite (2019) as the most-awarded foreign language film in the Oscars' history.
               [5] It was nominated in twelve categories for the 2023 German Film Awards.[6]</p>
